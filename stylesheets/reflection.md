    **What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

    It's hard to know when to include a border.  Padding makes more sense to me now-it keeps an element from being situated in a weird way.  Didn't use many margins, but I get that they keep elements from being glued to the sides of the page (if that makes sense).


    **What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

    Honestly I just kept getting more and more confused as time went on during this challenge-I would try one thing and it wouldn't do what I expected so I would revert it and then tinker with it for ages until it got passable.


    **What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

    It was easy to align the text.  It was (still is) pretty difficult for me to get things sitting where I wanted on the page, and I had a heck of a time getting my navbar and aside to sit horizontally and vertically, respectively.


    **What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

    When adding/formatting, it became quickly apparent that my HTML was missing some tags and classes that would make my life easier, and ultimately I'm still not especially happy with my site, but if I didn't stop after the 4 hour point I would've punched a hole in the wall.  Can you tell that this challenge was not a great one for me?
