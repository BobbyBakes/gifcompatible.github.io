<h3>Positioning</h3>
<p>
Let's start by thinking of a webpage as a big rectangle and a series of tiny little pieces called pixels.  Within that rectangle are different elements, or blocks.  Each of these blocks has a particular height and width, and you can specify the position of the blocks within the webpage.  If you imagine these blocks all coming together like pieces of a puzzle, this makes positioning easier to understand.
</p>

<p>
There are four types of positions: <b>absolute</b>, <b>relative</b>, <b>fixed</b>, and <b>static</b>.  Each of these positions will display a certain way on the webpage depending on how they are told in the html code to display.  The code for each of these has a similar layout, like so:
  <figure>
  <img src="/assets/example-code.png">
  </figure>
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of simplicity, all you really need to know here is that the "div" is referring to the block that will be in the position you tell it to be in, and the position is specified by typing the name of the position.  Pretty easy!
</p>

<h3>Absolute</h3>
<p>Positioning an element using absolute will move it where you want it to go, but also removes it from the page.

<h3>Relative</h3>
<p>By using relative positioning, you can tell the element where you want it to be relative where it would normally be (in the static position).

<h3>Fixed</h3>
<p>Putting an element in fixed position will keep it in one spot on the page regardless of how you move it-for example, it will stay in the same place even if you scroll up and down or side to side.

<h3>Static</h3>
<p>This is basically the default for positioning.  It's not positioned in one specific spot, but it will clear out any other positioning that may have been specified elsewhere.  It puts the element where it would be on a page.
