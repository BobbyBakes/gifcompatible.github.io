Here I am.  In Chicago.  Well, technically I got here several days ago, but that's not as dramatic.  Tomorrow, Phase 1 of DBC begins aka hibernation aka coding 12+ hours a day aka I may die...here are some initial thoughts:

-I'm scared
-I'm nervouse
-I'm excited
-I feel like puking
-I don't want to be here (in Chicago)
-I need to be here(the beginning of the rest of my life)
-I'm going to get donuts
-Everything will be ok
-HOLY SHIT I'M IN CHICAGO
-It's cold as fuck

Yeah...so I'm gonna try and blog when I can about new things I've learned and also my feelings throughout this process, but I had to get this word vomit out to cleanse my soul and get ready for tomorrow.  Later gators!
