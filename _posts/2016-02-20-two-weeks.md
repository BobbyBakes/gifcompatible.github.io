title: "Two Weeks"
---

I've been in Chicago now for TWO. FUCKING. WEEKS.  It's crazy to me how fast time is going by during onsite.  The first week was really tough and I had impostor syndrome something awful, but week has been a lot better.  We're getting into much more interesting stuff now and doing a lot of Object Oriented Programming, which I'm enjoying.  Next week we're digging deeper into database stuffs and I'm looking forward to it.  

On Wednesday we have our assessment to determine if we get to move on to phase 2, be invited to repeat phase 1, or get kicked the fuck out.  Nervous?  Me? NEVER!!  Just kidding...I'm really fucking nervous because I don't really want to be in Chicago any longer than I have to to, but if I end up needing to repeat phase 1, I know it will be a good experience either way.

Still...my feelings about the assessment right now can be summed up with a gif:
