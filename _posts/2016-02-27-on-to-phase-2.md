title: "On to Phase 2"
---

Holy mother of fuck.  HOLY FUCK.  First off something unrelated to DBC-my best friend, boyfriend, and I booked a flight to Japan (!!!) in May.  JAPAN.  I've always wanted to go to Japan because you know dreams and weeb life etc. etc. so I'm pretty flipping excited about that.

Ok now back to the topic that inspired the title of the post-phase 1 assessments were this past Wednesday, and going in I was worried about what all would be on there.  I talked to some of the phase 2 and 3 cohorts and they reassured me that it should be easier than what I expected, and lo and behold it was!  I managed to finish everything and get all the tests passing and didn't do too bad explaining my code in my review, but still I was super nervous about having to repeat...but I get to move on to Phase 2!  I'm terrified and excited all at once.  This will probably be my last blog post for a while as I'm sure things will be ramping up at a break-neck pace starting tomorrow with the prep work for Monday...but holy crap.  I can't believe phase 1 is already over and I'm moving into phase 2.  Everything is going by so quickly!!

Adios.
