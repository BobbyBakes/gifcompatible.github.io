                  <h3>Version control</h3>
                  <p>
                  Version control is similar to having multiple saves in a video game instead of one save file you overwrite; it allows you to see when you saved, what you were doing when you saved, and you can go back to that save if you mess up later in the game.  Version control is not just used by developers-it can be used for any number of things to keep track of overall progress on a project.  The great thing about version control is that it helps prevent fatal mistakes from being made.  Think of it as a series of do-overs!
                  </p>
                  <h3>Git</h3>
                  <p>
                  Git, not to be confused with GitHub, is GitHub's version control management (or VCS).  In other words, it's the software that GitHub uses for version control.  Git is great because it can be downloaded onto your computer so that you can fiddle with code without making changes to the existing code that could cause issues.  Git is especially useful because it provides a history of the saved changes (or "commits") made to code that developers work on, and allows for collaboration.  This means that multiple people can be using git and making commits all over the world without overwriting others changes.  Git shows you when each change was made as well as what was changed and who changed it.
                  </p>
                  <h3>GitHub</h3>
                  <p>
                  GitHub is essentially a virtual co-working space.  It uses git to keep track of changes made so that developers can collaborate on projects without altering the source code, which allows for changes to be made to a project on a larger scale.  GitHub is a great place to store code because others can contribute to your code and make suggestions and changes that you may not have thought of, while, as mentioned previously, not affecting your original code!  GitHub differs from git in that it exists remotely on the internet; you don't need to download any software to use it.
