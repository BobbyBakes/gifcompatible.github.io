How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was pretty awesome!  My pair and I worked well together and our ideas came together seamlessly.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I think so, but I'm not sure.  In challenge 2.6 we did not wireframe before developing the site and I think that went pretty well.  I think it will be more helpful when we get to the CSS.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We wanted to keep it simple-we didn't want the user getting distracted with unecessary navigation links or images.  We wanted the focus to be on the post itself, so all of our other wireframe elements were small and simple.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

<article></article> (useful for blog posts!) and <time></time> (date and time)
