                  Let's change it up this week and hop straight into the code:
<pre>
<span>class</span> Dog # this kicks off the class
<span>def</span> initialize(breed,name,weight) # building our "Dog" arguments
@breed = breed # the "@" makes instance variables
@name = name
@weight = weight
<span>end</span>
<span>def</span> info
puts "#{@name} is a #{@breed} and weighs #{@weight} pounds."
# what we want to do with the breed, name and weight variables
<span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Classes allow you to use the same code over and over for a certain type of object without having to rewrite it.
                  So we've learned how to define a method in ruby-we have some of that going on here with several new things.  On the first line, we kick things off by create a new object class "Dog".  Essentially, we can make a bunch of new dogs and have them all set up the same way!  The @ symbols on the 3 variables indicate that they are instance variables, meaning they can be accessed within other methods throughout the class.  The # followed by {} does something called interpolation-basically, whatever you happen to put there "Spike" or "Rex", "Golden Retriever" or "Pug", "190" or "50", it will insert it into our string to print that out.  Pretty flippin cool.

                  <h3>How to Make New Dogs</h3>
                  <p>So now that we've set up our class, we can create some new dogs.  We can do that like so:
<pre>
<span>new_dog</span> = Dog.new("Spike","golden retriever", "190") # enter the info
<span>new_dog</span>.info # print out the info:
"Spike is a golden retriever that weighs 190 pounds."
</pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                That's it.  That's all you have to do to create new dogs using the awesome Dog class we created. Classes, like bow-ties, are cool.  happy coding!
