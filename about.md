Hello everypony!  My name is Jenna and I'm from Columbus, OH.  I'm a huge geek-the level of my geekdom surpasses Godzilla's stature.  The main things I geek out about are My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Star Wars, Anime, gaming, and comics.  I got my degree in Linguistics and am currently attending Dev Bootcamp, but my passion lies with studying how my body aligns with my couch... A quirky fact about me that you can tell your friends?  I used to do two of the coolest sports ever: fencing and roller derby.
