Hello everypony!  My name is Jenna and I'm a software developer from Columbus, OH.  I'm a huge geek-the level of my geekdom surpasses Godzilla's stature.  The main things I geek out about are <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a>, Star Wars, anime and manga, gaming, and comics.  I have a degree in Linguistics and attended <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/locations/chicago/">Dev Bootcamp Chicago</a>, but my passion lies with studying how my body aligns with my couch... A quirky fact about me that you can tell your friends?  I used to do two of the coolest sports ever: fencing and roller derby.

If I sound like someone you want to know more about, you can find me elsewhere on <a href="https://github.com/gifcompatible">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gifcompatible">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gifcompatible/">Instagram</a>.  Or, you can <a href="https://t.co/1DJDah8dNi">hire me</a>!
